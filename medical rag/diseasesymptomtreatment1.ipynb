Based on the information available, high fever can be a symptom of several conditions, including Dengue Fever and Influenza (Flu). However, it's important to remember that many different illnesses can cause a high fever, and only a healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis.\n",

      "I strongly recommend that you consult with a doctor or visit a healthcare facility as soon as possible. They can perform the necessary tests and evaluations to determine the exact cause of your fever and provide you with the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, make sure to stay hydrated, rest, and monitor your symptoms closely.\n",
